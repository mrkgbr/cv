            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>I am an Engineering Manager based in Göd, Hungary.<br>
                I have been working in the technical field for more than 10 years. My main field is the production of
                steel structures and I have 5 years of management experience.<br>
                I like to learn new skills, especially things that make everyday life easier, like management
                techniques, programming and web design.

                <h3>Team Management</h3>
                <p>I graduated from MATE University, where there was a strong emphasis on management techniques. It gave
                    me a
                    comprehensive overview of the techniques available and their application. Currently, I lead a
                    technical team of
                    30 people. The team is responsible for production preparation, ordering and stocking raw materials.
                    I have a lot of challenges to improve my skills.</p>

                <h3>Excel</h3>
                <p>I have had to work with a lot of spreadsheets and databases, so I have learned to use functions and
                    write VBA macros to automate them. I also learnt how to use Power Query and Power Pivot, and
                    transformed the tables I regularly use into an automatable database.</p>

                <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>I love problem solving. I believe there is a solution to everything, even if it seems impossible at
                    first. There will always be problems to be solved, so don't be afraid of them.</p>

            <div class="skill-row">
                <img class="skills-img" src="./images/binary-code.png" alt="coding-img">
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Currently learning Python and Web Development, but I am also interested in other programming
                    languages. My goal is to create tools to make daily tasks easier<br>
                    The first major program I wrote was an excel macro, which saved me several days of work. At that
                    time, production lists were manually copied from a database based on various criteria. Several days
                    of work became 2 minutes.
                    With Python the first program I wrote was a bot that changed the production status of a product in the
                    web-based production management system, so colleagues could concentrate on more important tasks. The
                    system is old and slow, so changing a status can take up to 10 minutes while no useful work can be
                    done. <br>
                    And I still have a lot of ideas in my head that need to be implemented, but I still need to train myself.
